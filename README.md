An end-to-end pipeline is built to analyse the drying process of _Thomson seedless_ grapes to raisins. 
  
An experimental setup with an Data logger systems logs air conditions (air temperature and air humidity) under which the grapes are dried. Along with the air conditions water eveporates the the reducing weight of the grapes is recorded at a frequency of evey ten seconds.
